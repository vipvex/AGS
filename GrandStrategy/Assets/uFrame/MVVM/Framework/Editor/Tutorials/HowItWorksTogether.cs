This \"frame of mind\" for creating games is different than what most Unity developers are used to, but once understood the possibilities of where an idea can go are limitless.

A ViewModel serves as interface between the visual entities and logic of the game.

A View Component can read and modify the real-time data of a ViewModel, but isn't necessary for every element. It is only meant to provide an extra level of extendibility when needed. A View (which is technically a View Component, but with a larger role) binds to an element's data so that it's notified when something is changed. When these changes occur, it directs the View Component to execute the appropriate action. Views also execute the commands of events and interactions that occur in the scene (e.g. Collision, MouseClick, Hover). ");

This would more broadly explain its function and allow for items to be collected in a different way, if the developer so chooses.  ");
